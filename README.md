# Hi there
This is an open source Nuclear Fission simulator, which can later be used as an base for RBMK Simulations, BWR, PWRs, and any other model that uses Uranium and Neutrons 

# Dependcies
As of 7/29/2025, there are 2 dependicies.

First, you need to clone the repository into a folder (I recommend making a seperate folder in your ~/Documents Folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/izakyar/NFLibre#
```
then move into the folder using `cd` then the directory it has downloaded under ~/[Your Dir]/NFLibre
make a venv
``` 
python3 -m venv .venv
```
then activate it
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
then downlaod the dependices
```
pip install rich pygame
```
or
```
python3 -m pip install rich pygame
```
then run the main file
```
.venv/bin/python main.py
```
(these steps are still a WIP)
you are free to copy and fix up things
I **DID** use AI on the mathmatical parts of this project and not for anything beyound that
expect AI generated comments throughout the code

# yay
